# Hi 👋, I'm Jose

## 👨‍💻 Alea Frontend Knowledge Test!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started
Steps to get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
  `git clone https://github.com/josmadev/alea-frontend-test.git`
2. Install NPM packages
  `npm install`
3. Run the app with:
  `npm run start`
  
## Usage
To login into the app you should use a user *email* from this list:
* michael.lawson@reqres.in
* emma.wong@reqres.in
* emma.wong@reqres.in
* george.bluth@reqres.in
* anet.weaver@reqres.in

You can enter the *password* you like

Once logged in, you will go directly to the Users page.

## Improvements points and optimization
One of the points that need an improvement is especially the part of Unit Tests
Some components,  like buttons,  could be optimized by creating a reusable Button component for login, logout, and the 404 page button.
Other buttons (like pagination and users per page buttons) , inputs, titles, images, etc.

## Difficulties
The hardest part for me have been the Unit testing, because in my current job we don't make testing. I learned so much with this project and I want to continue improving the testing part!.
